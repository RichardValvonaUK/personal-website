<h2>Cheddar Cheese</h2>
<p>
Sadly, I haven't got a picture of a packet of cheese over here in the States. I was too eager to open the packet up and eat it as I was really hungry. However, I would like to make my own comments on it.

The Cheddar Cheese here is not bad. There are foods that I dislike here, but the cheese is not one of them. It's rather delicious to eat and tastes like English cheese. However, if you've never been to England, then you haven't experienced the real taste of Cheddar. The Cheddar cheese here actually tastes more like Red Leicester or Double Gloucester, two cheeses similar to Cheddar and made in a similar way.

<h3>What's Cheddar really taste like?</h3>
<p>
Unfortunately, I cannot really describe the taste in an accurate way. However, I'll do my best and would say it's generally stronger and with a more rounded flavour. More salty perhaps and sometimes more tangy (but not always).
