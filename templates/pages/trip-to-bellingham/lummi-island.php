<h3>Whale Cruise to San Juan Island</h3>
<p>

</p>
<p>
Anyway, we got on a small boat. It was a lot smaller than I expected but still big enough to accommodate all of the people who also went travelling. Sadly, I didn't get a photograph of the boat from the outside due to my failure to plan ahead. However, if I were to describe the size then I would say that the floor area is about the size of a decent-sized living room. Also, there's an upstairs and downstairs area along with outside areas so big enough to move around but small enough to be cosy.
</p>
<h3>So, what did we see?</h3>
<p>
Whilst out on the water, we saw porpoises flipping out of the water, an elephant seal on one of the port buoys. Unfortunately, we didn't see and whales on this occasion and so recieved vouchers for 50% off our next trip. However, it was still a pleasant day out and we were provided with a nice lunch on-board.

<h3>On San Juan Island</h3>
<?php echo \Images::create('right-floating-image', 'entering-friday-harbour.jpg', null, null); ?>
<p>
When we arrived at San Juan Island, we were told that there was a "resident" seal that lives in the harbour. We were hopeful that we would see it but instead it was jellyfish we saw. How similar can you yet! I was amazed that some of our fellow passengers were poking their fingers and touching these jellyfish knowing full well that they can sting. I have no clue what species of jellyfish these are but they looked much smaller than the ones we find at home.
</p>
<p>
The atmosphere of the island had a very slow and laid back vibe about it, similar to back at home on the Isle of Wight. It was a lovely sunny day and we just decided to stay near to the harbour and relax in the sunshine. After an hour's walking early in the morning, we didn't feel like doing anymore walking. Also, time was limited so we explored some of the local shops which surprisingly for America were very close together like a town back at home.

<h3>Drinking magic potion</h3>
<?php echo \Images::create('left-floating-image', 'green-coffee-water.jpg', 300, null); ?>
<p>
Therefore, went to look for somewhere to get a coffee and first came across "The Coffee Bar". I expected it to be just a normal place to get a coffee and because it was small, assumed that it was a coffee take-away service. I was wrong! It was actually a type a place to do with cleansing and detoxing.
</p>
<p>
The lady who runs it had this green tonic potion-looking thing made with coffee beans and we tried it. I was surprised she didn't have a broomstick with her. It didn't really have much of a taste but it was still meant to give the caffiene hit with additional health benefits. Not really my type of thing however this place would definitely be good for the hippy traveller.

<h3>Getting a *real* drink</h3>
<?php echo \Images::create('right-floating-image margin-at-bottom', 'the-bean-cafe-san-juan-island.jpg', null, null); ?>
<p>
However, we stopped at <?php echo URLS::absLink('The Bean Café', 'http://www.thebeancafe.com/', null); ?> and had a large latté and must say that it was a really decent cup. I wasn't even aware that their coffee was locally sourced until looking at their website just now. This place was also recommended to us by the lady who runs The Coffee Bar so we bump it up to three people who recommend it here.

<h3>Looking out on the harbour</h3>
<p>
We took our coffees out down to by the sea and had a relaxing look around the harbour. As I've been trying to take as many bird photos as possible whilst out in the States, there was another type of bird which landed on one of the wooden stumps. I zoomed in and to my joy it was a kingfisher. I honestly didn't think I'd get a picture of one since seeing kingfishers back at home has been very unsuccessful for me. They just never seem to show themselves despite having a bright electric blue and orange plumage. Here is more information about <?php echo URLS::absLink('the Belted Kingfisher in the United States', 'https://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/Belted_Kingfisher/id', null); ?> and also the <?php echo URLS::absLink('species of kingfisher back in the UK', 'https://www.rspb.org.uk/discoverandenjoynature/discoverandlearn/birdguide/name/k/kingfisher/', null); ?>.
